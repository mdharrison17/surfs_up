##Challenge 9 Analysis

The main difference in weather between June and December is that December has considerably colder temperatures at the min and 25th percentile. There is only a slight difference in temperature between June and December at the 50% percentile and max.
December does get more rain than June does but as you move from the min to the max, the differences in rain gets larger.
There is only a slight difference in the mean temperatures for the month, about a 3 degree difference.
The weather does not seem to be much different from June to December.
For further analysis, I would take the data information from the weather stations and plot on a map the to see the weather patterns across the island.
A very important piece of weather information for surfing would be to integrate wind information.  Would look at wind speed and durations and plot when good surfing conditions.
I would also suggest cross the temperature information with wind information to see if there is good surfing even when it isn't hot out, you could sell ice cream if the surfing side of the business was slow.
